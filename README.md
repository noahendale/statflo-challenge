# CRM - demo - redux

Based off of http://reactjsnews.com/your-first-redux-app to provide simple CRM functionality, such as:
* Add a lead (name, phone number),
* Log a call,
* Schedule an appointment,
* Convert lead to account

With bonus points for:
* Updating the phone number,
* Using a date-picker for the appointment.

In terms of visual styling, something similar to the visual style of our products on [statflo.com](http://www.statflo.com/product-overview.html) is ideal unless you'd like to make your own

To run the app:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Load `http://localhost:8080`
